# binaryDecodingGame
Basic Arduino game for teaching Math and Computer Science

For now a student chooses a word and fills it on the code, the arduino converts it to binary using a toy protocol for alphabet/decimal/binary/LEDs:
- A = 01 = 0001 = OFF,OFF,OFF,ON
- B = 2 = 0010 = OFF,OFF,ON,OFF
- ...and so on...
- O = 15 = 1111 = ON,ON,ON,ON

Because for this class we only have four LEDs working on the kit until the components arrive :)
